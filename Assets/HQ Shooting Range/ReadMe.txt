First of all thank You very much for purchasing this asset!

Enabling post processing:


1) Download and import Post Processing Stack from here - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/content/83912


2) Drag the PostProcessLayer.cs script from the project folder to the camera.


3) Choose post processing profile, that included in this project.


For maximum awesomeness we recommend that you work in Linear + HDR. It will still work in Gamma + LDR, although it won't look as good with some effects.
